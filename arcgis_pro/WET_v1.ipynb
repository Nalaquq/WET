    "# Waterway Erosion Tool (WET) V1.0\n",
    "### A simple open source ArcPy script for measuring coastal and riverine erosion in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### This is a simple tool to measure how much a waterway has changed. To use this script, a copy of ArcGIS Pro 3.0 is required, along with two pre-georeferenced images of the region of interest: \n",
    "###### a) Add the two images to your ArcGIS Project \n",
    "###### b) Move the WET_v1. ipynb file to project folder, by default this is in My Documents-> ArcGIS-> Projects-> \"project name\". Open the Catalog pane, right click on Folder->expand project folder and right click on the ipynb file. Add it to the project. The script can now be run from the Notebooks folder in the catalogue pane.\n",
    "##### c) Digitise the waterway edge in question  for both images as a line feature, and note the directory. You will need to add it in Step 3 below. Complete Steps 1 to 4 below, the run the script. This should produce two outputs: i), a table detailing how much erosion has taken place. ii)  Sampling lines at the interval specified in Step 2 below."
